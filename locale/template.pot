"After a rope ladder is placed on a vertical wall it will begin extending "
"downward until it reaches its maximum length (%dm). If the rope ladder is "
"removed all of the ladder below the point of removal will disappear. A rope "
"ladder can be severed partway down using an axe or similar tool, and the "
"ladder below the point where it is cut will collapse. No rope is actually "
"lost in the process, though, and if the uppermost section of the ladder is "
"removed and replaced the ladder will re-extend to the same maximum length as "
"before."

"Rope boxes have a certain amount of rope contained within them specified in "
"the name of the node. They come in five standard lengths (%dm, %dm, %dm, %dm "
"and %dm) that can be crafted by combining and splitting up rope boxes in the "
"crafting grid. For example, you can craft a %dm rope box by combining two %"
"dm rope boxes, and the two %dm rope boxes can be recovered by splitting the %"
"dm rope box back up in the crafting grid."

"When a rope box is placed the rope will immediately begin lowering from it "
"at one meter per second. The rope will only descend when its end is in the "
"vicinity of an active player, suspending its journey when no players are "
"nearby, so a long descent may require a player to climb down the rope as it "
"goes. Take care not to fall off the end! The rope will stop when it "
"encounters and obstruction, but will resume lowering if the obstruction is "
"removed."

msgid ""
"A rope can be severed midway using an axe or other similar tools. The "
"section of rope below the cut will collapse and disappear, potentially "
"causing players who were hanging on to it to fall. The remaining rope will "
"not resume descent on its own, but the rope box at the top of the rope "
"\"remembers\" how long the rope was and if it is deconstructed and replaced "
"it will still have the same maximum length of rope as before - no rope is "
"permnanently lost when a rope is severed like this."
